					<h3>Extra University work</h3>
					<section>
						<h4>AUEB University</h4>
						<p>I'm currently studying at the Athens University of Economics and Business(AUEB).
							Through out the course of studies I've collaborated with fellow students and contributed to team projects. Some of those contributions can be seen on GitHub at a repository created by one of my co-partners. The repository contains projects from a few students and involves most courses available at AUEB.</p>
